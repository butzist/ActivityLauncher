<i>Activity Launcher</i> lets you create shortcuts for any installed app and even hidden activities to launch them with ease. This is as easy as 1-2-3:

* use the integrated browser to look for existing apps and their activities
* give it a description and optionally pick an icon
* push the button and enjoy!
