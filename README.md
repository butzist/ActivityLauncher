## Shortcuts not created

In case the shortcuts are not created in your home screen, make sure Activity Launcher has the "Home screen shortcuts" permission.

Click on Settings -> Apps -> Manage apps -> Activity Launcher -> Other permissions -> Home screen shortcuts.

See [#267](https://github.com/butzist/ActivityLauncher/issues/267).
